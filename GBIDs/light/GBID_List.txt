-1411700210	=	The Green Hills Of Stranglethorn, Page 4	=	Lore	=	Console	=	For this expedition I have assembled Ajeck Rouack and Sir S. J. Erlgadin, along with my trusted servant, Barnil Stonepot.  I fought alongside Ajeck’s father’s side in many battles in defense of the Alliance. Her father schooled her well in the ways of weaponry, and her skills with a bow make me wonder if there is elven blood running through those veins.
-1411700209	=	The Green Hills Of Stranglethorn, Page 8	=	Lore	=	Console	=	During one such misstep, Erlgadin laid a heavy hand on Barnil’s shoulder.  Ajeck and I gave a casual glance, assuming the man was simply giving Barnil a much-needed scolding for his carelessness.  Erlgadin, however, gestured slowly with his head toward a nearby fallen tree.  Gazing back at us were two piercing black eyes just above a mouthful of razor sharp fangs.
-1411700208	=	The Green Hills Of Stranglethorn, Page 15	=	Lore	=	Console	=	Both Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin stood poised, guns leveled at the bristling overgrowth at the base of the swaying trees.  The midday sun beat heavily upon us.  A slow trickle of perspiration trailed down from Erlgadin’s temple as he pulled the pin back.  Upon the sound of the click, the thick fauna parted and a large black panther -- a beautiful specimen -- darted out onto the plain.
-1411700207	=	The Green Hills Of Stranglethorn, Page 16	=	Lore	=	Console	=	I had promised the expedition that we would spend the next day hunting panthers, as their furs are in high demand throughout Azeroth.  It only makes sense that such demand should exist with all of the able-bodied hunters, trappers and fur-traders off giving their lives so valiantly in the name of the Alliance.
-1411700206	=	The Green Hills Of Stranglethorn, Page 23	=	Lore	=	Console	=	The hunters were now the hunted. I led the party toward the sea, hoping the shoreline would provide refuge from the Raptors.  In our haste we had drifted too far north, to a precariously high elevation.  The mistake was made.  The fault was mine.  We stopped just short of a sheer cliff, the Raptors just a few paces behind.
-1411700205	=	The Green Hills Of Stranglethorn, Page 42	=	Lore	=	Console	=	Later that night we sat quietly around the campfire, knowing our lives had been saved by a bizarre twist of fate.  Such are the risks of the big game hunter.  We toy with fate by delivering it.  Yet each of us, at some point, will face fate’s razor sharp teeth.  This Dwarf is just glad that moment did not come upon the green hills of Stranglethorn.
